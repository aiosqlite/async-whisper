You don't let them take a fight, press your patience
Tell them that it's over, hang out the bed
Oh, you need me as me, but you know your balance
You ain't gotta be frustrating
I don't wanna, I ain't no game, play no games
Fuck along, get my life ready
You know you gotta be the same damn thing
That's okay, good baby
You gotta, girl, you gotta
You gotta, girl, you gotta
